# Cyberbullying Detection Using NLP and Deep Learning

- Compared and analyzed performances of Logistic Regression and LSTMs to classify tweets for cyberbullying detection with an accuracy of 91.2%.
- Used the Twitter hate speech dataset from Kaggle.
- Preprocessed the data and performed Feature Engineering.
- Used SMOTE for oversampling the 'not-cyberbullying' label
- Used Word2Vec and Glove to extract feature sets from the dataframe.
- Applied Logistic Regression and LSTMs to train the model.
- Performed hyperparamter tuning to obtain optimal parameters for LSTM.
-  Used accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score for evaluation.
